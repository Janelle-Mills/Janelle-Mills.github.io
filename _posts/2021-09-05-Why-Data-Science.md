I spent six years in university, earning degrees in civil engineering and construction management. At the same time, I spent two years working in an engineering laboratory, followed by more than 5 years working in the construction industry. 

While I derived enjoyment in heavy civil work, I found myself wanting to get involved in renewable energy generation and management. The path I am choosing to take in that direction involves data science. 

How can data science skills be applied? My plan is to use my skills in project controls (cost analysis, scheduling and planning, and commerical management). Data science can be used to visualize current progress. More importantly, data science can be used to make predictions about what will happen based on past performance. In infrastructure development projects, data science can be used to analyze the profitability of a project or deciding the placement projects in one location versus another. 

To practice my data science skills, I will focus on using energy and construction datasets wherever possible. It will help me learn about the data to expect while in the field.
