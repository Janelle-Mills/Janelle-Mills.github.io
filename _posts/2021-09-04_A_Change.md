I started studying Python and Data Science with [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science) in July/August. I withdrew from my program this week. 

**Why did I withdraw?** I am looking to pivot in m career, but I want to be financially responsible. I decided to look into other programs and found that I can receive comparable training from other sources for a lower cost. While the course I'm taking now does not have live instructors, it does have online support and the ability to contact the teaching team who are featured in the self-paced videos and homework assignments.

**What am I doing instead?** I am taking the [IBM Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-data-science?index=product&queryID=d0fdc4c0fad17a2a2f245fd80a98e345&position=2) course on edX. I'll be posting my homework assignments and projects as I work through the course. I'm commiting to learning the ways of the data science but I want to use as few resources as possible.

**But, can't you learn online for free?** More than 20% of data scientists are self-taught. Theoretically, yes, I could teach myself. I am looking for a structured program, however, that provides a reputable certification at the end.
